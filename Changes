Revision history for Perl extension PGXN-API-Searcher.

0.7.1
      - Switched to Search::Query::Parser for query parsing. There is a lot
        more syntax with this parser, including `field=` or `field:` queries,
        as well as wild cards.
      - A searcher object is now created for every call to `search()`, rather
        than just once in `new()`. Parsers are cached from `new()` on,
        however. This means that consumers can keep a PGXN::API::Searcher
        object persistent in memory without worrying about index invalidation.

0.7.0   2011-03-31T20:55:51
      - Augmented the docs a bit.
      - Updated for new index names in PGXN::API v0.7.0.
      - Changed the index parameter name from `index` to `in`. And of course
        they're now all required to be plural.
      - Removed the `index` key from the results.

0.6.2   2011-03-29T01:13:48
      - Updated for "doc" changes in PGXN::API v0.6.6:
        + The "path" key in doc results has been renamed "doc".
        + The "doc" key has been added to extension results.

0.6.1   2011-03-28T03:07:13
      - The index to query is no longer specified as the first argument to
        `search()`, but via the new `index` parameter.
      - The `index` paraemter defaults to "doc" if it's not specified.
      - Pass parameters to `search()` as a list rather than a hash reference.
      - Add `index` key to the returned hash.

0.6.0   2011-03-26T03:14:12
      - Initial version.
